print("=" * 80)

print("\nüéØ ISSUES IDENTIFIED:")
print("1. Bot was taking 2 BUY trades instead of 1 BUY + 1 HEDGE")
print("2. ROI logic was not executing actual sell orders on exchange")
print("3. Trailing stop logic was not executing actual sell orders on exchange")
print("4. Hedge exit logic was using wrong criteria (coverage vs ROI)")
print("5. Trade counting logic was counting hedge pairs instead of individual trades")

print("\n‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:")

print("\n1. STRICT TRADE LIMITS:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Modified execute_trade() to check total active trades (max 2)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added check: len(active_trades) >= 2 prevents new positions")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Modified hedge pair limit to 1 (allowing 1 buy + 1 hedge)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Enforced ONE_TRADE_PER_PAIR configuration")

print("\n2. ROI LOGIC FIXES:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Fixed check_roi_exit() to execute actual market orders")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added reduceOnly parameter for position closure")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Improved profit calculation for both long and short positions")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added proper leverage calculation using get_trade_leverage()")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added Telegram notifications for ROI exits")

print("\n3. TRAILING STOP FIXES:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Fixed check_trailing_stop() to execute actual market orders")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added reduceOnly parameter for position closure")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Improved max_price tracking and trailing stop price calculation")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added proper error handling for order execution")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added Telegram notifications for trailing stop exits")

print("\n4. HEDGE EXIT LOGIC FIXES:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Changed exit criteria from 'hedge coverage' to 'total ROI > -5%'")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added proper ROI calculation: total_pnl / total_invested")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Modified _close_hedge_pair() to use actual market orders")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added comprehensive error handling for position closure")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added detailed exit reasons and Telegram notifications")

print("\n5. ORDER EXECUTION IMPROVEMENTS:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ All exit functions now use create_market_order() with reduceOnly")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added proper error handling for failed order executions")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Improved logging with order IDs and execution details")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Added fallback error handling for exchange API issues")

print("\nüìä CONFIGURATION VERIFICATION:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ MAX_TRADES = 2 (1 buy + 1 hedge maximum)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ ONE_TRADE_PER_PAIR = True (prevents multiple pairs)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ HEDGE_TRIGGER_LOSS = -5% (triggers hedge at 5% loss)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ TRAILING_STOP = True (enables trailing stop)")
print("   ‚Ä¢ ROI table: 70% @ 0min ‚Üí 0% @ 120min")

print("\nüéÆ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:")
print("1. Close any existing positions manually first")
print("2. Start the bot with: python main.py")
print("3. Bot will take maximum 1 long position")
print("4. If long position loses 5%, bot will hedge with 1 short position")
print("5. When total ROI > -5%, bot will close both positions")
print("6. Monitor via web interface at http://localhost:5000")

print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Bot now strictly enforces 2-trade maximum")
print("   ‚Ä¢ All exit logic executes real orders on exchange")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Hedge exit triggers when total loss < 5%")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Web interface shows actual leverage from exchange")
print("   ‚Ä¢ Emergency kill switch available for manual closure")
