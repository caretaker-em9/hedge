print("\nðŸŽ¯ ISSUES FIXED:")
print("1. Hedge trigger was not activating at -5% loss")
print("2. Hedge was triggering at much larger losses (-20%+)")

print("\nâœ… CORRECTIONS MADE:")

print("\n1. HEDGE TRIGGER FIXED:")
print("   OLD: if pnl_pct <= hedge_pair.hedge_trigger")
print("   NEW: if loss_pct <= -0.05  # Exactly -5%")
print("   RESULT: Hedge now triggers at exactly -5% loss")

print("\n2. HEDGE EXIT FIXED:")
print("   OLD: Exit when ROI > -5% (loss recovery)")
print("   NEW: Exit when ROI >= 1% (profit achieved)")
print("   RESULT: Exits when loss is covered + 1% profit")

print("\n3. IMPROVED LOGGING:")
print("   â€¢ Added detailed loss percentage logging")
print("   â€¢ Added hedge trigger activation alerts")
print("   â€¢ Added ROI monitoring for exit conditions")
print("   â€¢ Added Telegram notifications for hedge events")

print("\nðŸ“Š EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:")
print("   â€¢ Long position enters at market price")
print("   â€¢ Hedge triggers when long loses >= -5%")
print("   â€¢ Short position opens to protect against further loss")
print("   â€¢ Both positions close when combined profit >= 1%")
