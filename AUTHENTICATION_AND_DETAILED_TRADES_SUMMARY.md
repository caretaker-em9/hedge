- **Route protection** with `@login_required` decorator on all API endpoints
- **Session timeout** with configurable duration (3600 seconds default)
- **Professional login interface** with Bootstrap styling
- **Flash message system** for user feedback
- **Auto-redirect** to login page for unauthenticated users

### 2. Enhanced Trade Tracking
- **Detailed entry reasons** with technical indicator analysis
- **Comprehensive exit reasons** explaining why trades were closed
- **Market condition assessment** (trend, volatility, volume profile)
- **Technical indicator data** (RSI, SMA Fast/Slow, MACD signals)
- **Enhanced Trade dataclass** with new fields:
  - `entry_reason`: Detailed explanation of why the trade was opened
  - `exit_reason`: Detailed explanation of why the trade was closed
  - `technical_indicators`: Dict containing RSI, SMA, MACD values
  - `market_conditions`: Dict containing trend, volatility, volume analysis

### 3. Web Interface Enhancements

## Configuration

### Authentication Settings (config.py)
```python
# Web Interface Authentication
WEB_USERNAME = "admin"
WEB_PASSWORD = "hedge123"
SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600  # 1 hour in seconds
```

### Hedging Strategy Settings
```python
INITIAL_BALANCE = 30.0
MAX_TRADES = 2
LONG_POSITION_SIZE = 5.0   # $5 for initial long position
SHORT_POSITION_SIZE = 10.0  # $10 for hedge short position
HEDGE_TRIGGER_LOSS = -5.0   # Trigger hedge at -5% loss
```

## Key Components

### 1. Session Management (web_interface.py)
- `login_required()` decorator for route protection
- Session-based authentication with timeout handling
- Secure cookie management
- Flash message integration

### 2. Enhanced Trade Class (trading_bot.py)
```python
@dataclass
class Trade:
    # ... existing fields ...
    entry_reason: str = ""
    exit_reason: str = ""
    technical_indicators: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
    market_conditions: dict = field(default_factory=dict)
```

### 3. Detailed Reason Generation
- `_generate_long_entry_reason()`: Creates detailed entry explanations
- `_generate_hedge_entry_reason()`: Explains hedge trade triggers
- `_assess_market_conditions()`: Analyzes current market state
- Technical indicator integration with trade reasoning

### 4. Frontend Display (dashboard.html)
- Enhanced table with new columns for detailed information
- JavaScript functions for formatting trade data
- Responsive design for detailed information display
- Professional styling with Bootstrap components

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Starting the Application
```bash
cd /home/caretaker/Desktop/hedge
source trading_bot_env/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### 2. Accessing the Web Interface
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `hedge123`
3. Navigate the enhanced dashboard with detailed trade information

### 3. Trade Information Display
The dashboard now shows:
- **Entry Reason**: Why each trade was opened (technical analysis)
- **Exit Reason**: Why each trade was closed (profit target, stop loss, hedge completion)

## Security Features
- Session-based authentication (no tokens stored client-side)
